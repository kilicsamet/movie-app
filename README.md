## `Version Tagging and Pushing`



### `Create a New Version Tag`

When creating a new version for the project, you should update version tags only after pushing your code changes. Follow these steps to tag and push versions.
```
 git tag v1.0.1

```

This command tags the current commit as v1.0.1. Tags are used to mark specific points in the repository's history, typically after changes have been made.

### `Push the Tags to the Remote Repository`

```
git push --tags 
 
```
This command pushes the created tags to the remote repository

**Note:** Version tags should be created only after code changes have been pushed and tags must always differ from the previous version.
